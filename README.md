## Initial thoughts on game structure

I think the logic is going to trip me up a bit, there is a bunch of things that I need to keep track of. Game state and where its at will be key to making everything work. I feel weaker in logic so I wanted to push myself a bit.

## Phases of Completion

phase -4: Fill out my 3x5 cards and get a lay of the landscape

phase -3: Arrange my divs and get the layout roughly together

phase -2: Get the javascript working for each 3 x 5 card

phase -1: Connecting all the javascript together

phase 0: MVP

phase 1: expand the game for further by adding more people places and things
